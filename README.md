# C-Plus-Plus-Application-Development-1

This hands-on intermediate level course assumes a prior knowledge of object-oriented programming and follows on from COMP 1451.
Students must already understand object-oriented programming (OOP) before starting this course. Participants start their
examination of C++ by comparing previously learned OOP characteristics and mapping these to C++.
This course will cover C++11 features as they apply to the learning outcomes. Topics include: 
Classes, Control Statements,Arrays, Pointers, Stream I/O and the C++ string class. Since the C language is a subset of C++, 
students will be also earning some first level C programming which is continued in COMP 2717. 

Upon successful completion, the student will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Explain and use C++ Classes in conjunction with proper object-oriented programming techniques.</li>
<li>Explain, in terms of the C++ programming language, object-oriented programming concepts including: classes, objects, methods and encapsulation.</li>
<li>Explain abstraction and modularization in programming in terms of the C++ programming language.</li>
<li>Identify and use Control Statements in C++ programs.</li>
<li>Identify and use Global Functions.</li>
<li>Identify and use Arrays.</li>
<li>Identify and use Pointers and Strings.</li>
<li>Explain and use C++ Stream Input/Output.</li>
<li>Test and debug C++ programs</li>
</ul>
